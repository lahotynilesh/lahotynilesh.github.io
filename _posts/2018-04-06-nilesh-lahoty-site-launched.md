Well. Finally got around to putting this old website together. 
Neat thing about it - powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and I can use Markdown to author my posts. 
It actually is a lot easier than I thought it was going to be. Special mention to [this](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/) tutorial which made it so easy! 
I will obviously change the whole layout & design of this website, but for now something is better than nothing!
